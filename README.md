### About

Government works best when it’s government by the People. On August 11th, join Code for Miami and the
Code for America Brigades as we host National Day of Civic Hacking–a nationwide day of action to bring together
civic leaders to work with our local governments to tackle some our toughest challenges.

This event will bring together urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, community organizers
and anyone with the passion to make our city better. We will collaboratively build new solutions using
publicly-released data, technology, and design processes to improve our communities and the governments that serve them.
Anyone can participate; you don’t have to be an expert in technology, you just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
